    <p class="resume">
        We will discuss in this section about how every operation works. We will start with the external operations,
        the one which a client uses (insert, delete, lookup, range query) with its variants (binary and linear lookups,
        sequential and parallel range queries). And maintenance operations in the second part, indirectly
        triggered by a client (split, merge, update number of keys).
    </p>

    <h3>Asynchronous communications</h3>
    <p>
        Every communication is asynchronous and every message between two (possible) remote machine has an acquittal.
        A message from a Pht node to another is a PhtMessage: this message containes the minimum information such as
        the initiator of the operation. If more information is needed, a PhtMessage can be extended with a PMLookup,
        which can also be extended with a PMRangeQuery. This works like a russian doll: PhtMessage is the biggest one,
        PMLookup is the one a little bit smaller and PMRangeQuery again a little bit smaller.
    </p>
    <p>
        This system avoids having one big type of message with unused fields for the majority of operations. It also
        helps
    </p>

    <h3>External operations</h3>
    <p>
        The overall conduct of an operation goes like this (we do not treat the case of a client outside of the peer to
        peer network network):
        <ol>
            <li>The client asks the Pht layer for an operation.</li>
            <li>The Pht layer sends a first response with an operation id if the operation can start or an error
            code (negative value) if the layer cannot start a new operation.</li>
            <li>The Pht layer starts the operation with asynchronous communications.</li>
            <li>When it receives the final answer (data searched, final acquittal), it informs the client.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        Since the communications with the client are trivial, we will focus only on the Pht part.
    </p>

    <h4>Insertion</h4>
    <p>
        An insertion is a two steps operation:
        <ol>
            <li>Lookup to seek for the Pht node responsible for the given key.</li>
            <li>The key and the data is send to this node directly (without Dht routing).</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        Note as for every operation, each step has an acquittal: the first is used to inform the initiator (hence the
        direct connection is possible), and the last to provide information about the insertion (everything went ok or
        not, a split has started or not).
    </p>

    <h4>Delete</h4>
    <p>
        A delete operation is even simpler: a lookup is send
