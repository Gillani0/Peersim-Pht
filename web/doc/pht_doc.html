    <p class="resume">
        We give here a brief summary of a Prefix hash tree (Pht). For a more precise informations, please read the
        <a href="https://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sylvia/papers/pht.pdf">original paper</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Data Structure</h3>
    <p>
        Prefix hash tree is a distributed data structure that relies on a Distributed hash table (Dht). Every node of
        the tree is labeled with a binary string, e.g.: the sons of a node whose label is <em>l</em> will be
        <em>l0</em> and l1. It has the following properties:
        <ol>
            <li>(Universal prefix) Each node has either 0 or 2 children.</li>
            <li>(Keystorage) A key K is stored at a leaf node whose label is a prefix of K.</li>
            <li>(Split) Each leaf node stores atmost B keys.</li>
            <li>(Merge) Each internal node contains at least (B+1) keys in its sub-tree.</li>
            <li>(Threadedleaves) Each leaf node maintains a pointer to the leaf nodes on its immediate left and
                immediate right respectively.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <h3>Operations</h3>
    <p>
        A Pht provides some basic and more complex operations. The basic ones are:
        <ol>
            <li>Insert: insert a key with its data into the Pht.</li>
            <li>Delete: delte the given key with its related data from the Pht.</li>
            <li>Binary lookup: try different prefix of the key until the leaf whose label is a prefix a the key, is
            founded.</li>
            <li>Linear Lookup: start a lookup from the root node.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        The two more complex operations are range queries. To work they need a to use one of the two possible lookups.
        <ol>
            <li>Sequential Query: search for the leaf which is responsible for the beginning of the range key, then use
            the links between leaves to visit every leaf that has key in the searched range.</li>
            <li>Parallel Query: search for the node whose label is the smallest common prefix between the beginning and
            the end of the range keys, and flood its sub-tree (the leaves in the range will send their keys).</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
